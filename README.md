# RAG_GoogleColab
This section of the notebook initializes a vector database using Milvus with LangChain. 
It creates a temporary .db file to store and retrieve embedding vectors generated from documents or queries. 
This setup is essential in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines, allowing efficient similarity search during response generation.

The key steps include:
1. Importing Milvus and tempfile
2. Creating a temporary database file
3. Initializing the Milvus vector store with the embedding model and file path

üîÅ You can replace Milvus with another vector store (like FAISS, Pinecone, or Chroma) by referring to LangChain‚Äôs vector store documentation.

# Choose Your Vector Database (LangChain + Milvus)
This section of the notebook sets up a **local vector database** using **Milvus** through LangChain, allowing storage and retrieval of embedding vectors for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows.


## Purpose
In RAG pipelines, we need a vector database to:
- **Store document embeddings**
- **Retrieve similar documents** based on user queries
This example uses a **local instance of Milvus** via a temporary `.db` file created at runtime.


## Requirements
Make sure the following libraries are installed in your Colab/virtual environment:
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-milvus
